Workforce Management Backend – Railse Assignment
Hey there! 👋

This is a backend API I built for the Railse Backend Coding Challenge. The goal? To manage tasks assigned to team members — from creating and reassigning them to prioritizing, commenting, and filtering — all done using lightweight in-memory storage. It’s a compact yet powerful system to keep staff workflows organized and on track.

🧠 What’s Inside
✅ Bug Fixes
Duplicate Tasks on Reassignment: Fixed! When a task is reassigned, the original one is now marked as CANCELLED to avoid clutter.

Too Many Tasks Showing Up: Tasks marked CANCELLED are now excluded from date-based views for a cleaner experience.

✨ New Features
Smart Daily View: See all tasks that are either newly created today or older ones that are still open — so nothing slips through the cracks.

Task Prioritization: Tasks can be marked as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. You can also update and filter them based on priority.

Comments & Activity Logs: Add comments to tasks, and the system automatically tracks any changes to their status or priority.
